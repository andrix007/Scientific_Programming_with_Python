    "# List comprehensions\n",
    "List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists. They can replace the need for multiple lines of loops and conditions, making your code more readable and expressive. There are several forms of list comprehensions, which I'll explain through examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Basic List Comprehension**\n",
    "The most straightforward form of list comprehension involves iterating over an iterable (like a list or range) and optionally applying an expression to each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the list comprehension iterates over `range(5)` and squares each number, resulting in a list of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **List Comprehension with Condition (Filtering)**\n",
    "You can include a condition in a list comprehension to filter elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(evens)  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This comprehension filters out the odd numbers and only includes even numbers in the resulting list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **List Comprehension with Multiple `for` Loops**\n",
    "You can use multiple `for` loops in a single list comprehension, which is equivalent to nested loops in traditional for-loop syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item1 in iterable1 for item2 in iterable2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pairs = [(x, y) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in ['a', 'b']]\n",
    "print(pairs)  # Output: [(1, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'a'), (3, 'b')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a list of tuples, where each tuple is a combination of elements from the two lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **List Comprehension with Nested List Comprehension**\n",
    "List comprehensions can also be nested within each other, useful for flattening lists of lists or working with multi-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "flattened = [element for row in matrix for element in row]\n",
    "print(flattened)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This comprehension flattens a 2D matrix into a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **List Comprehension with Condition Inside the Expression**\n",
    "You can also use conditional expressions (ternary operators) directly within the expression part of the list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression if condition else alternative_expression for item in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "labels = [\"even\" if x % 2 == 0 else \"odd\" for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(labels)  # Output: ['even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even']\n",
    "```\n",
    "This comprehension creates a list that labels each number as \"even\" or \"odd\" based on its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Combining Conditions and Multiple `for` Loops**\n",
    "You can combine multiple `for` loops and conditions in more complex list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pairs = [(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3, 6) if x + y > 5]\n",
    "print(pairs)  # Output: [(0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This comprehension generates pairs `(x, y)` but only includes those where the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **List Comprehension with Function Calls**\n",
    "You can use list comprehensions to apply a function to each item in an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = [square(x) for x in range(5)]\n",
    "print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This comprehension applies the `square` function to each number in the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Dictionary Comprehension**\n",
    "Although not a list comprehension, dictionary comprehensions work similarly and are worth mentioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squared_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}\n",
    "print(squared_dict)  # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a dictionary where the keys are numbers and the values are their squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Set Comprehension**\n",
    "Similarly, set comprehensions create sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{expression for item in iterable}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "unique_squares = {x**2 for x in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]}\n",
    "print(unique_squares)  # Output: {0, 1, 4}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a set of unique squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "List comprehensions are a powerful and concise way to generate and manipulate lists in Python. They can include simple iterations, conditions, multiple loops, nested comprehensions, and even function calls. They improve code readability and performance compared to traditional loops."
