    "# Basics of Sets in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **set** in Python is a collection of unique elements. Sets are unordered, which means the elements don't have a specific order, and mutable, so you can add or remove elements from them. Python sets are similar to mathematical sets and provide a way to perform standard set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Difference**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **difference** between two sets is a set containing elements that are in the first set but not in the second set. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Identifying Employees Not Assigned to a Specific Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two sets:\n",
    "- `all_employees`: a set of all employees in a company.\n",
    "- `project_team`: a set of employees assigned to a particular project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to find out which employees are not assigned to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "all_employees = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"}\n",
    "project_team = {\"Alice\", \"David\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Employees not in the project team\n",
    "not_in_project = all_employees.difference(project_team)\n",
    "print(not_in_project)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Eve'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Union**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **union** of two sets is a set containing all unique elements from both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Creating a List of All Participants in Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have two sets:\n",
    "- `event_a`: a set of participants in Event A.\n",
    "- `event_b`: a set of participants in Event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to find out all unique participants across both events.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "event_a = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"}\n",
    "event_b = {\"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# All participants in either Event A or Event B\n",
    "all_participants = event_a.union(event_b)\n",
    "print(all_participants)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Intersection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **intersection** of two sets is a set containing only elements that are in both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Identifying Common Skills Between Two Candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two sets:\n",
    "- `candidate_a_skills`: a set of skills Candidate A possesses.\n",
    "- `candidate_b_skills`: a set of skills Candidate B possesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to find out the common skills both candidates have.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "candidate_a_skills = {\"Python\", \"Java\", \"SQL\"}\n",
    "candidate_b_skills = {\"Java\", \"C++\", \"SQL\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common skills between both candidates\n",
    "common_skills = candidate_a_skills.intersection(candidate_b_skills)\n",
    "print(common_skills)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'Java', 'SQL'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Symmetric Difference**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **symmetric difference** between two sets is a set containing elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Finding Exclusive Items Between Two Shopping Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two shopping lists:\n",
    "- `shopping_list_a`: a set of items in Shopping List A.\n",
    "- `shopping_list_b`: a set of items in Shopping List B.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to find out which items are unique to each shopping list (not shared between them).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shopping_list_a = {\"milk\", \"bread\", \"butter\"}\n",
    "shopping_list_b = {\"bread\", \"cheese\", \"yogurt\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Items unique to each shopping list\n",
    "unique_items = shopping_list_a.symmetric_difference(shopping_list_b)\n",
    "print(unique_items)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{'milk', 'butter', 'cheese', 'yogurt'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- **Difference**: Elements in one set but not in the other.\n",
    "- **Union**: All unique elements from both sets.\n",
    "- **Intersection**: Common elements between two sets.\n",
    "- **Symmetric Difference**: Elements unique to each set, excluding the common ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are particularly useful in various computational problems, such as filtering data, merging datasets, finding commonalities, and identifying differences."
