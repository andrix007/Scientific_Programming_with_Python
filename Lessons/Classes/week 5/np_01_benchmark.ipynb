    "# NumPy Arrays vs. Built-in Python Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the superiority of **NumPy arrays** over **built-in Python lists**, especially in terms of speed, memory efficiency, and functionality, we can perform an operation where both structures handle large datasets. Specifically, we will compare **element-wise operations** like adding two arrays or lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Element-Wise Addition of Two Large Lists/Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use two large lists/arrays and perform element-wise addition. We'll compare the performance of NumPy arrays vs. Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points of Comparison:\n",
    "- **Performance (Speed)**: NumPy is significantly faster for large datasets due to its implementation in C and optimized vectorized operations.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: NumPy uses less memory as it stores elements in a contiguous block of memory, unlike Python lists, which store references to the actual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Size of the dataset\n",
    "size = 10 * 10**6  # 1 million elements\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Using Python built-in lists\n",
    "list1 = list(range(size))\n",
    "list2 = list(range(size))\n",
    "\n",
    "start_time = time.time()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Element-wise addition using list comprehension\n",
    "result_list = [list1[i] + list2[i] for i in range(size)]\n",
    "\n",
    "end_time = time.time()\n",
    "list_time = end_time - start_time\n",
    "print(f\"Time taken for addition using Python lists: {list_time} seconds\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Using NumPy arrays\n",
    "array1 = np.arange(size)\n",
    "array2 = np.arange(size)\n",
    "\n",
    "start_time = time.time()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Element-wise addition using NumPy arrays (vectorized operation)\n",
    "result_array = array1 + array2\n",
    "\n",
    "end_time = time.time()\n",
    "numpy_time = end_time - start_time\n",
    "print(f\"Time taken for addition using NumPy arrays: {numpy_time} seconds\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the speed difference\n",
    "speedup = list_time / numpy_time\n",
    "print(f\"NumPy was {speedup:.2f} times faster than Python lists.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Time taken for addition using Python lists: 0.238 seconds\n",
    "Time taken for addition using NumPy arrays: 0.004 seconds\n",
    "NumPy was 59.50 times faster than Python lists.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "1. **Performance (Speed)**: The time taken by NumPy is significantly lower than the time taken by Python lists. This is because NumPy uses vectorized operations, which means the addition is handled in C under the hood, avoiding Pythonâ€™s loop overhead.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Memory Efficiency**: NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient because they store data in a contiguous block of memory. Python lists, on the other hand, store references to objects, which takes up more space.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Functionality**: NumPy provides many additional features like broadcasting, slicing, and more efficient manipulation of data that are either unavailable or less efficient using Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "For large datasets and element-wise operations, **NumPy arrays** outperform **Python lists** both in terms of **speed** and **memory usage**. This makes NumPy a superior choice for numerical and scientific computations."
