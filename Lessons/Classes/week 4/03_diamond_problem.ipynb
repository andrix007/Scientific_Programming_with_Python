    "### Diamond Problem in Python Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "The **diamond problem** arises in **multiple inheritance**, where a class inherits from more than one parent class, and these parent classes share a common ancestor. The issue occurs when there are two or more paths to access the common ancestor's attributes or methods, leading to ambiguity and confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is referred to as the **diamond problem** because of the shape that the class hierarchy forms when diagrammed: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        A\n",
    "       / \\\n",
    "      B   C\n",
    "       \\ /\n",
    "        D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- **Class B** and **Class C** both inherit from **Class A**.\n",
    "- **Class D** inherits from both **Class B** and **Class C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can cause ambiguity when **Class D** tries to access a method or attribute from **Class A**. The question arises: **Which path should be followed to inherit the method from Class A?** Through **B** or through **C**?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Diamond Problem in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the base class A\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class B inherits from A\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from B\")\n",
    "        super().greet()  # Call A's greet method\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class C also inherits from A\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from C\")\n",
    "        super().greet()  # Call A's greet method\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class D inherits from both B and C (diamond inheritance)\n",
    "class D(B, C):\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from D\")\n",
    "        super().greet()  # Call B's greet method\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of D and call greet\n",
    "d = D()\n",
    "d.greet()\n",
    "\n",
    "# The output:\n",
    "# Hello from D\n",
    "# Hello from B\n",
    "# Hello from C\n",
    "# Hello from A\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Class A** is the base class, and it has a `greet()` method.\n",
    "- **Class B** and **Class C** inherit from **Class A** and both override the `greet()` method.\n",
    "- **Class D** inherits from both **Class B** and **Class C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an instance of **Class D** and call the `greet()` method, it follows the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**, which determines the path the interpreter should follow to resolve method calls. Python follows a depth-first, left-to-right strategy based on the MRO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Breakdown:\n",
    "1. **Class D's** `greet()` method is called first (as `D` is instantiated).\n",
    "2. Inside **D's** method, `super().greet()` calls **B's** `greet()` method because **B** is the first class in the MRO for **D**.\n",
    "3. Inside **B's** method, `super().greet()` calls **C's** `greet()` method because **C** is next in the MRO after **B**.\n",
    "4. Finally, **C's** method calls **A's** `greet()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MRO (Method Resolution Order) in Python:\n",
    "Python uses the **C3 Linearization algorithm** to resolve the diamond problem. The MRO ensures a deterministic order of method calls in case of multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the MRO for any class using the `__mro__` attribute or the `mro()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(D.mro())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that Python will look at **D**, then **B**, then **C**, and finally **A** in the event of a method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Diamond Problem in Python:\n",
    "Python handles the diamond problem better than some other languages (like C++) due to its MRO and the use of `super()`. By following the MRO, Python ensures that each method is called only once, even if multiple classes share a common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **super()**: It works with the MRO to ensure that the next class in line is called, avoiding duplicate calls to the same method.\n",
    "2. **MRO**: Determines the order in which methods are resolved when dealing with multiple inheritance.\n",
    "3. **Diamond Problem**: In Python, it is handled gracefully using the C3 linearization algorithm, ensuring that each class in the hierarchy is visited once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the diamond problem can cause issues in languages like C++, Python's MRO and `super()` help avoid such issues by providing a predictable method resolution path."
